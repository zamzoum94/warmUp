/*
1. create a data model to represent your classmates
    • think of different attributes of your classmates? what do all of them have ?
    • create a factory function.
    • create an array to hold the classmates that you created and what you created to it .
    • write a function called displayFriend that takes a mate as an argument and returns the important information in a readable way.
    • write a function called addFriend that takes a mate as an argument and add it to you classMates arraya.
    • calculate the number of male friends that your class have by writing a function called nbOfMale.
    • Write a function searchMates that, given a query and an array of Mates,
      searches the array of mates for "matching" mate. You will decide what way you want to write your search algorithm.
